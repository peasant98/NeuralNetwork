# Neural Network

A small and straightforward Neural Network, from scratch (with good ol' Numpy, of course).

Tests the digits dataset (digits 0 to 9) against the network.

Testing data finishes around with 98% accuracy. 

Check out the Python notebook for more, and for a demo of the network in action.
